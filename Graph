    A graph is said to be connected if every pair of vertices in the graph is connected. 
    The example graph on the right side is a connected graph.
    It possible to determine with a simple algorithm whether a graph is connected:
    Choose an arbitrary node x of the graph G as the starting point
    Determine the set A of all the nodes which can be reached from x.
    If A is equal to the set of nodes of G, the graph is connected; otherwise it is disconnected.
